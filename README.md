PS: I have made this bot on replit: https://replit.com/@DhruvAthaide
And since Replit dosen't support FFMPEG anymore I have used the Following Workaround where all I did was go to the project, then go to packages and search for ffmpeg then install it. After that, go to Files, click the three dot button and show hidden files. You'll see replit.nix file, open it and you'll see a list named deps. Add pkgs.ffmpeg to that list and the bot will work!
